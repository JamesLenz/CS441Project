<h1>Project Description</h1>
<p>
Our product is a mobile app on Android and iOS for intuitive student/instructor communication designed to increase productivity, communication, and learning comprehension. A problem we are trying to solve in some similar applications is that their environments don’t have a user friendly implementation, such as Cougar Courses. Most other applications for communication do not focus on a classroom environment. This app is compelling to develop because chat apps are popular, but apps oriented toward the classroom environment are few are far in between. It will contain features designed to accommodate a student’s and instructor’s interests and needs.
</p>

<h1>Target Customers</h1>
<p>
Our primary target customers are students and instructors in higher level educational and learning environments, such as high school and college. However, this app can be used in any environment that can benefit from a mobile classroom platform.
</p>

<h1>Objectives</h1>
<p>
● To provide a mobile application which functions as a classroom chat and learning management system
● Implement an easy to use and friendly user interface
● Provide users the ability to create accounts and manage profile settings
● Implement a form of classroom role differentiation to allow users different privileges based on role
  ○ Instructors have administrative control
● Allow users to interact through private, group, and course wide chat rooms and forums
