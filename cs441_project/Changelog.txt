-Added alert for when successful recovery email sent


Server








(Oct 15, 2017)
Client
-Moved ValidateUserItem, ForgotPasswordItem, and AddUserItem to a new file "ServerItems.cs"
    -Added ResponseItem to this file, the standard object returned by server
-All responses from server no longer a string, now deserialized into ResponseItem
-Moved "HttpClient client" object and settings code to a global public instance in "App.xaml.cs"
 so all pages can use it without reconnecting
    -Access it with App.client
-Changed Email_Entry Entry box "Keyboard" propery to "Email" in "cs441_projectPage.xaml"
-Added ResourceDictionaries to XAML pages:
    -cs441_projectPage.xaml
    *other xaml files could use this, but this isn't that neccessary. its just to tidy up
-Made HomePage accessible by successfully logging in
-Homepage is now a TabbedPaged and added 3 tabs
    -Tab 1 = testPage1 (added iOS icon)
    -Tab 2 = testPage2
    -Tab 3 = testPage3
-Added icons to iOS resources folder
    *Note: @1x, @2x, @3x are so the app can choose an appropriate size
        -I chose 30x30, 60x60, and 90x90 respectively
 

Server
-Added getResponseJSON function to create a standard for responding to client, structure of
 JSON is below
        '{
            "Success" : <true | false>
            "Response" : "<response text, optional>"
            "Data" : <extra data, optional> #if no data, then use "" or None, both will be treated as an empty string
        }'
    -Updated functions in "index.py" to return data in this way
-Fixed double quotes in strings causing errors in JSON, replaces double quotes with proper escape character
